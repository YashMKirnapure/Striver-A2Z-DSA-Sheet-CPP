/*
1. Build the SPF array (Smallest Prime Factor):
    For every number i from 2 to N, initialize spf[i] = i (assume itâ€™s prime).
    Then, for each prime i, update its multiples with the smallest prime that divides them.
    So, after this step, spf[x] tells you the smallest prime factor of x.

2. Use SPF to factorize N quickly:
    Keep dividing N by its smallest prime factor (spf[N]).
    Record that factor.
    Repeat until N = 1.

3. The result is the prime factorization of N in ascending order.
