/*
1. Start checking numbers from 2 onwards (since 2 is the smallest prime).

2. For each number i, see if it divides n:
    If it does, that means i is a prime factor of n.
    Add i to the list.
    Then, keep dividing n by i until it no longer divides evenly â€” this makes sure we only record that prime once.

3. Keep moving up until you reach the square root of n.
    Why stop there? Because if n had a factor bigger than its square root, the matching partner factor would already have been found earlier.

4. At the end, if n is not reduced all the way down to 1, then whatever is left is also a prime number, so we add it to the list.
