/*
ðŸ”¹ noOfGasStationsReq(stations, dist)

For every consecutive pair of stations:

Check the gap between them.

Figure out how many extra stations are needed so that no segment is longer than dist.

Formula:

noInBetween = (stations[i] - stations[i-1]) / dist


(essentially splitting the gap into parts of length â‰¤ dist).

Adjust edge case if it divides evenly.

Return total new stations required.

ðŸ”¹ findSmallestMaxDist(stations, k)

Search space:

low = 0.

high = max distance between consecutive stations.

Binary search on answer (distance):

mid = (low + high) / 2.

Count how many new stations would be needed if the max distance allowed is mid.

If more than k â†’ mid is too small, so increase low.

Else â†’ feasible, shrink high.

Stop when precision â‰¤ 1e-6 â†’ high gives the minimized maximum distance.
